# TeslaClone🚗🚘🏎

## My Goal

The objective of this project was to clone the Tesla's official website Homepage as a hybrid application using JavaScript & React-Native. The application renders a list of Tesla cars along with a beautiful animation while scrolling. The images are fetched using an API Call. The application is compatible on various platforms like Android, iOS, and Web.
